#PivotTable.js

PivotTable.js is a Javascript Pivot Table library with drag'n'drop functionality built on top of jQuery/jQueryUI 
and originally written in CoffeeScript 
by [Nicolas Kruchten](http://nicolas.kruchten.com) at [Datacratic](http://datacratic.com). 
It is available under an MIT license (see bottom of this document).

##What does it do?

PivotTable.js' basic function is to turn a data set into a summary table and then optionally add a true 2-d drag'n'drop UI to allow a user to manipulate this summary table, turning it into a pivot table, very similar to the one found in older versions of Microsoft Excel with a bunch of extra developer-oriented features and some visualization effects. 

With an optional add-on, the summary table can be rendered as a Google Chart, turning the pivot table into a pivot chart. A d3-based Treemap add-on is also included.

##Why is it good?

* lightweight: the core (without Google Charts or D3 support) is a single file with less than 1000 LOC of CoffeeScript, compiles down to 6.3kb of Javascript minified and gzipped, depends only on jQuery and jQueryUI's 'sortable'
* works wherever jQuery and jQueryUI work (tested with jQuery 1.8.3 and jQueryUI 1.9.2)
* works acceptably fast in Chrome on commodity hardware up to around a hundred thousand records, depending on the cardinality of the attributes.
* UI is [localizable](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Localization)
* layered architecture allows for summary table generation with or without the pivot table UI around it (if you don't use the UI, then there is no dependency on jQueryUI)
* works with common [input formats](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Input-Formats)
* [derived attributes](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Derived-Attributes) can be created on the fly based on the whole input record by passing in a function
* complex [aggregation functions](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Aggregators) can compute values based on the whole input record (e.g. weighted averages)
* built-in support for basic heatmap and bar chart [renderers](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Renderers), and optional support for [Google Charts](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Google-Chart-support)
* extension points allow aggregation functions, table output, UI and visualizations to be tailored to specific applications
* works on mobile devices with jQuery UI Touch Punch


##Where's the demo?

A demo of PivotTable.js loaded up with a sample dataset of Canadian Members of Parliament as of 2012 can be found here: [PivotTable.js demo](http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/mps_prepop.html). 

A version of this demo which include Google Chart renderers can be found here: [Google Charts demo](http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/gchart.html).

A fully-loaded version with all renderers and jQuery UI Touch Punch for mobile compatibility is here: [Fully Loaded demo](http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/fully_loaded.html).

Finally, here is a demo where you can view your own data from a local CSV file, 
all in-browser with no server support: [Local CSV demo](http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/local.html).

##How do I use the UI?

PivotTable.js implements a pivot table drag'n'drop UI similar to that found in popular spreadsheet programs. 
You can drag attributes into/out of the row/column areas, and choose a summary function. 
If you choose a summary function that takes an argument, like 'average', you'll have to drag a attribute onto the dropdown. 
There is a [step-by-step tutorial](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/UI-Tutorial) 
in the wiki but the following animation gives you a taste of the interaction. 
It's based on the Canadian Parliament 2012 dataset.

##How do I use the code?

There are two main functions defined in `pivot.coffee`: `pivot()` and `pivotUI()`, both implemented as jQuery plugins, as well as a bunch of helpers and templates.

Despite the fact that this is described as a Javascript library, it's actually written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org). You can compile `pivot.coffee` into `pivot.js` with `coffee -c pivot.coffee` or you can use the precompiled JS file from the `examples` directory.

Once you've loaded jQuery and pivot.js, this code ([demo](http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/simple.html)):

	$("#output").pivot(
	    [
	        {color: "blue", shape: "circle"},
	        {color: "red", shape: "triangle"}
	    ],
	    {
	        rows: ["color"],
	        cols: ["shape"]
	    }
	);

appends this table to `$("#output")` (the default, *overridable* behaviour is to populate the table cells with counts):

A slight change to the code (calling `pivotUI()` instead of `pivot()` ) yeilds the same table with a drag'n'drop UI around it, so long as you've imported jQueryUI ([demo](http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/simple_ui.html)):

	$("#output").pivotUI(
	    [
	        {color: "blue", shape: "circle"},
	        {color: "red", shape: "triangle"}
	    ],
	    {
	        rows: ["color"],
	        cols: ["shape"]
	    }
	);
